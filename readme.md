Welcome to the Wordomancy Alpha! If you're here, you should know how to get in.


There's still a lot missing and some things might not work, so feedback is very encouraged and appreciated. You can send it to me (Robin) [by email](mailto:wordomancy@cosmogr.am) or any other way.

## Roadmap

### Known issues

- Text fields can be weird
  - Pressing enter to submit adds a Q
  - Focus state isn't predictable
  - Changing the text in the middle of the word moves the caret to the end
- Spellword & Guess inputs lets you add repeat invalid letters
- Colors need tweaking and accessibility check
- Layout issues on small screens
- No favicon or sharing metadata
- Feedback on remaining guesses
- Hint feature probably needs tweaking
- Guesses should scroll up when new ones are added and the screen is too small (instead of pushing the keyboard down)
- Word lists need to be filtered, may contain inappropriate words right now

### Planned features

- Actual Spell submission + sharing
  - Share Spell url creates accessible image
- Friends page (with their latest Spells)
- Daily Spell
- Explanations + acknowledgments
- Setting
  - Choose color for letter states
  - Toggle letter hints

### Future considerations

- Stats, play history
- Animations everywhere âœ¨
- Other languages / kb layouts
- Word definitions at game end
- Maybe add button to shuffle letters of forecast words
