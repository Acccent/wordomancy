Welcome to the Wordomancy Alpha!


There's still a lot missing and some things might not work, so feedback is very encouraged and appreciated. You can send it to me (Robin) [by email](mailto:wordomancy@cosmogr.am) or any other way.

## Roadmap

### Known issues

- ⚠️ There may be a bug where a misplaced letter is highlighted several times in a guess, when it's only once in the solution 
- Text fields can be weird
  - Focus state isn't predictable
  - Changing the text in the middle of the word moves the caret to the end
- Spellword & Guess inputs lets you add repeat invalid letters
- Colors need tweaking and accessibility check
  - Focused buttons retain their color even if they become disabled (until unfocused)
- Layout issues on small screens
- No sharing metadata
  - Share Spell url creates accessible image
- Word lists need to be filtered, may contain inappropriate words right now

### Planned features

- Friends page (with their latest Spells)
- Explanations + acknowledgments
- Settings
  - Choose color for letter states
  - Toggle letter hints

### Future considerations

- Stats, play history
- Animations everywhere ✨
- Other languages / kb layouts
- Ability to give names to Spells?
- Word definitions at game end
- Maybe add button to shuffle letters of forecast words
- Share energy forecast
