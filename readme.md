Welcome to the Wordomancy Beta!


There's still a lot missing and some things might not work, so feedback is very encouraged and appreciated. You can send it to me (Robin) [by email](mailto:wordomancy@cosmogr.am) or any other way.

### Planned features

- Sharing
  - [ ] Spell url creates accessible image
  - [ ] Share energy forecast button
  - [ ] Add page metadada

- Settings
  - [ ] Toggle letter hints
  - [ ] Choose color for letter states
- [ ] "Give up" button

### Future considerations
